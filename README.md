# An Analyis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing Kickstarter analysis to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
A crowd funding campaign project would like to get started to fund a play. This project analyzes Kickstarter dataset to uncover trends in campaign outcomes. After almost meeting fundraiser goals for the play Fever. Addtional insight is needed to analyize the data for campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.

### Analysis and Challenges
The first analysis is performed by creating pivot table with data for campaign outcomes of successful, failed or canceled based on Theater launch dates. A line chart was created to vizualize relationship between the launch dates and outcomes.

The second analysis is perfomed by creating a spreedsheet with fundraising goals for plays data based on various dollar amount ranges for successful, failed, canceled outcomes, along with total projects and percentages for each campaign outcome. A line chart is created to visualize the relationship between goal outcome ranges.

The most challenging aspect I found making sure syntax for functions was correct and understanding which data is needed to answer the questions. I overame the challege by thoroughly examining and following the guidelines for each function written. I aslo utilize the formula builder to assist with correcting the functions.

#### Results
Launching a campaign in May and June has the highest success rates. Also, the highest failed outcomes are the months of May,June, July, Aug, and October with no significant difference. 

The least successful and failed campaigns are with fundraisng goals ranging from 45000 to 49999.

The data is limited because outcomes by launch dates for theaters does not provide the percentages to compare each data set based on success or failure. There is overlap in some months with both high success and failure outcomes. I think another line chart with total percentages would have provided better insight to conlude definintely which months are best for a successful outcome.
